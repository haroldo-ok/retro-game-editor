# Retro Game Editor

An editor for making games for retro platforms with little to no programming knowledge.

*Work in progress*

## Tools used

* [Jannone's Tiny Sprite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinysprite/): Nice web-based sprite editor, originally designed for MSX.
* [Nikky's Tiny Map Editor](https://github.com/nikki/tinyMapEditor/): Pretty basic map editor. With some modifications, it will do the job nicely.
* [Jannone's bitz80](https://github.com/jannone/msx-bitz80): a Z80 assembler made in JavaScript; will be used to assemble the ROMs
* [Guillaume Marty's jsSMS](https://github.com/gmarty/jsSMS): A very good SMS emulator made in JavaScript
