<h3>What's BiT?</h3>
</a>

<p>
	BiT is a Z80 ASM Editor <i>and</i> Assembler. <br />
	It helps you to edit your code, presenting real-time information about labels, instructions, execution time, and so on.<br />
	BiT is written entirelly in Javascript. It's <b>NOT</b> Java.

<h3>Filesystem access and security issues</h3>
</a>

Firefox allows local file access for reading/writing, <u>when granted by the user</u>.<br />
This is a very important detail. Since BiT uses this feature to load and save ASM files on your hard-drive, you'll only be able to that if you grant access.<br />
Tipically, if you download BiT and run locally, the browser will ask your permission when executing a file operation.<br />
When running BiT online, however, you'll need to set an extra configuration key.<br />
Sounds confusing but it is actually quite simple. Read onto the next section.

<h3>Enabling file access for online use</h3>
</a>

Follow these simple steps:
<ul>
	<li>Open Firefox</li>
	<li>In the URL box, enter <b>about:config</b></li>
	<li>Locate the key <b>signed.applets.codebase_principal_support</b></li>
	<li>Set this key's value to <b>true</b></li>
	<li>Done!</li>
</ul>
This allows online apps to have file access. <u>Firefox will still ask your permission at each file operation.</u><br />
So as long as you only grant access to legitimate apps, there's nothing to worry about.
